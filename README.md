# MI &mdash; Monokai Intensified

This is a colour theme for Visual Studio Code that is based on the
[Monokai Accent theme](https://github.com/tw-studio/monokai-accent) and the
[Monokai Vibrant theme](https://github.com/dylantmarsh/monokai-vibrant).

The theme is designed with a focus on C#, C++, and Python.
It also works well for other languages (however, intensive testing has not been conducted).

This theme fully supports semantic highlighting.
